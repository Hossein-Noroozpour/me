            <h2>More details</h2>
            <p>
                I began to learn programming at high school(~2006) because of my passion for games. I started my programer career in 2011, at the first I was a self employed programmer and mostly I was freelancing, till in late 2012 I joined a game developer group. After 1
                year we started our own studio, and I was cofounder in it for 2 years. We shipped two title 1- <a href="https://cafebazaar.ir/app/com.kabir.roll/?l=en">Rolling Lazies</a>, 2- <a href="https://cafebazaar.ir/app/com.hexypixel.farmthief/?l=en">Farm Thief</a>.
                After <a href="https://cafebazaar.ir/app/com.hexypixel.farmthief/?l=en">Farm Thief</a>, I left the studio (at the time, its name was HexyPixel). After leaving I employed by <a href="http://www.ravanertebat.com/">AEC</a> as a graphic programmer
                in their 3D printing section. I worked there a year then I went to another compny because of financial stuff. But meanwhile of all aforementioned, I've always pursued my passion, that is nothing but creating game and learning its related
                technologies.

                            Sinse 2013 I was about creating a game engine. I've spended and I'm spending my spare time on it. During this years I had developed several graphic renderer.
                            <a href="https://github.com/Hossein-Noroozpour/gearoenix"> Gearoenix game engine </a> is the latest version of it. The previous version was
                            <a href="https://github.com/Hossein-Noroozpour/vulkust"> Vulkust </a>. Since <a href="https://github.com/Hossein-Noroozpour/gearoenix"> Gearoenix </a> I changed my approach from purely technichal to a more bussiness oriented
                            approach. <a href="https://github.com/Hossein-Noroozpour/vulkust"> Vulkust </a> was a total extreme technical move and it slowed me for reaching an acceptable result. But currently <a href="https://github.com/Hossein-Noroozpour/gearoenix"> Gearoenix </a>                            has a business oriented approch and right now I'm developing a game with it.
